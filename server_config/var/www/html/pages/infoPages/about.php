        <p>This project is called Unboxing Biological Complexity. It was created to increase usability of the Geometry of Behavioral Spaces (GOBS) framework, a procedure created by Martin Cenek and Spencer Dahl, and to make the GOBS framework available to the public. The purpose of the GOBS framework is to help predict future movements of a system based on observed movements. </p>
        <p>Consider analyzing migration patterns of salmon in hopes of finding a solution to the current issue salmon are facing â€“ the inability to migrate back to their spawning areas to lay eggs. Approaching this problem without the Unboxing Biological Complexity project would require 1) collecting salmon movement data, 2) creating models based on this data, and 3) manually analyzing these models. However, thousands of salmon are involved in the model and there are numerous parameters that need to be compared between. The result is numerous models that would take years to analyze by a human.</p>
        <p>The Unboxing Biological Complexity project will increase the speed with which these models are analyzed and will create an output to the analysis that is easily readable and informative. Not only could the project lead towards providing insightful data to the cause of helping salmon return to their spawning areas, the project can take in any sort of data regarding the movement of agents (like traffic patterns, elk in the Alaskan wilderness, etc.) and deliver meaningful data about them.</p>
